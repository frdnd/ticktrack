## Awesome electromechanical projects

### Sequencer
  * [Teensy midi euclidean sequencer (arduino IDE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqOsPZUo860)
    * i'll build a variant based on 3x 24-led-rings
      * interface will be 3x3 sliders for step-length, num-steps, offset
      * based either on teensy playing digital samples or arduino activating solenoids

### Solenoid based instruments
  * [Solenoid acoustic drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6YOYpnz9Lw)
  * [MIDI Solenoid Drummer #crickit #feather @adafruit #adafruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcz0BvNOc4c)
  * i'll build a variant of the above based on 5v and 12v solenoids
    * either combining the solenoids with a euclidean sequencer
    * or replaying a mp3 and syncing the stems of kick/drums/highhat to the solenoids (will be difficult to get the stems correctly)
    * midi maybe later
  
### Talks
  * [Motors, Magnets and Motion/Ableton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHwhb99Bzo)
    * the first two artists are quite interesting
  * i plan to build a variant above
    * based on teensy and piezo microphones, how to design the amp-circuit?
